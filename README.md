rating (1-5)

* Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

* I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

* I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

* I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated above the chosen selection
